🚀 Intelligent Resource Allocation & Utilization Tracker (IRAUT)
📌 Overview

The Intelligent Resource Allocation & Utilization Tracker (IRAUT) is a Python-based application designed to solve a real-world problem faced by IT service companies — inefficient resource utilization.

Instead of only managing employee data, this system analyzes employee utilization and intelligently recommends the best-fit resource for a project while preventing over-allocation.

This project focuses on decision-making logic, not just CRUD operations.

🎯 Problem Statement

In service-based IT organizations, poor resource allocation can lead to:

Bench time (underutilized employees)

Employee burnout (over-allocation)

Project delivery delays

IRAUT helps by:

Tracking employee utilization

Identifying utilization risks

Recommending optimal resource allocation with justification

✨ Key Features

Add and manage employee details

Add project requirements

Analyze employee utilization (Underutilized / Optimal / Risk)

Intelligent resource recommendation

Over-allocation prevention (utilization ≤ 100%)

Detailed report generation with justification

Persistent data storage using files

🧠 System Design

The project follows a modular architecture:

Employee & Project → Data models

FileManager → Handles file-based persistence

ResourceAllocator → Core business & decision logic

Main Controller → Application flow & user interaction

Reports → System-generated analytical outputs

This separation of concerns makes the system scalable and maintainable.
